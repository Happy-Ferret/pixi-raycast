pixi-raycast
============

Simple raycaster built using Pixi.js

Inspired by this article: http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/ - skybox image credit to that and Dan Duriscoe.

This is a lazy refactoring of the C code from this article http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html into Javascript modules. More to come!
